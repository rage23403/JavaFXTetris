# ConsoleTetris

To compile and run. Compile on inputManager.java

Game's "Garbo()" method is purely for debugging in BlueJ because sometimes it can run slowly and needs a garbage collection.

inputManager is the main class and has become the entire interface. Game still exists because the logic and movement will still be running in a separate thread.

Pause button pauses the game's thread. Reset button resets the game and current score.
